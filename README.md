## An Overview of CitiBike usage in New York City

### Results: 

####
- Use of bikes is more popuar now than 30+ years ago. This could be explained by the increase of accessability for bikes. Bikes are now cheaper to produce and purchase which, as a result, increased bike usage throughout the population. 
- More males are seen riding bikes. Because this study is done in New York City, a heavily crowded city, women might be disuaded from utilizing bikes on a day to day basis with fears of getting kidnapped. 

- Bikes are not used for long distances. This could be explained by how exhuasting it is to ride a bike. Similarly enough, because the streets are very crowded in New York, people might be disuaded from riding far distances. If a customer were to ride a long distance in a crowded area, then the cost of a bike would be higher; conseuqently, having already paid a higher price, you wouldn't go as far either since you can only go about the speed of traffic. Not many bike riders are comfortable enough to ride on the streets, especialy tthose crowded such as  New York. 

- Bikes are more commonly used on outskirts of town. A possible explantion for this could be due to people wanting to cruise around the edge of the city along the water as well as avoid the crowded streets in a more central New York. 

### Recommended Visualizations: 
 #### 
 - Time upon bikes are initially rented
 - A demonstration of areas more populated by residents
 - Heavily congested areas
